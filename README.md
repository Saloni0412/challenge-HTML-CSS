# Challenge-HTML-CSS

## Description

This project was created to enhance the accessibility feature for the website so it will be easier for people with special abilities to go through the content. Moreover, condolidating CSS and HTML code base gave a better understanding and snatched look to the code. The important takeaway for me was how to consolidate the codebase in a way that the website look same but at the same time it should have assessibility feature and should follow DRY rule method.

## Usage

This is a website for a marketing agency and they do not have accessibility features and their code base was not properly organised. The website can also be used by poeple who have vision issues, and they will have the audio option to understand the image, Moreover the contrast of the colour are organised in a way that no one should have issues with the contrast colours. This website also has keyboard accesibility, so you can toggle through different tabs using tab key. The screenshots for this website are attached below:
